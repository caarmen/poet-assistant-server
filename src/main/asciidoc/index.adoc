Start the application:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew bootRun

=== Rhymes

.request
include::{snippets}/rhymes/curl-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/rhymes/response-body.adoc[]

=== Thesaurus

.request
include::{snippets}/thesaurus/curl-request.adoc[]

.response

=== Definitions

.request

=== Word of the day

==== Today's word of the day

To get today's word of the day, specify no query parameter:

.request
include::{snippets}/wotd/today/curl-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/wotd/today/response-body.adoc[]

==== Paginated list of words of the day

To get one page of words of the day, leading up to a specific date, specify the `before` and `size`
parameters.

For example, to get the words of the day of the last week of 2021:

.request
include::{snippets}/wotd/list/curl-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/wotd/list/response-body.adoc[]

Note: since the word of the day endpoint is infinite pagination, and since there is one word for each date in time, the response body provides no indication of the total number of items, nor the "id" of the next or previous page.
